/**
 * Tests for runPreRunPull's skip/run gate.
 *
 * Regression coverage for the bug where a sandbox recreated after expiry could
 * silently restore its branch from a *stale* `baseBranch` tip (when the real
 * branch restore fetch/checkout failed — see createSandboxForChat's
 * `branchRestored` flag). The old gate (`!createdSandbox`) treated every
 * freshly created sandbox as already current, so that stale case never got a
 * chance to catch up before the agent started committing on top of it — the
 * turn's end-of-turn push then failed as a non-fast-forward rejection with no
 * indication of why. The gate must still run the pull when `createdSandbox` is
 * true but `branchRestored === false`.
